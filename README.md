Synthetic datasets are an emerging method originally developed to permit the sharing of confidential census data. Synthetic datasets mimic real datasets by preserving their statistical properties and the relationships between variables. Importantly, this method also reduces disclosure risk to essentially nil as no record in the synthetic dataset represents a real individual. This is the accompanying R script for [my primer](https://psyarxiv.com/dmfb3/), which enables behavioral researchers to create synthetic datasets and assess their utility via the `synthpop` R package. By sharing synthetic datasets that mimic original datasets that could not otherwise be made open, researchers can ensure the reproducibility of their results and facilitate data exploration while maintaining participant privacy.
